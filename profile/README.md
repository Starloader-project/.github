This is the public organisation holding the repositories from galimulator's starloader project.
If you wanted to look for a mod loader for Starmade, you are on the wrong page.

## Getting started

SLL is the heart of the project, you can get it by either compiling it yourself, which gives you the most flexible experience from
https://github.com/Starloader-project/Starloader or by installing one of it's [releases](https://github.com/Starloader-project/Starloader/releases/tag/v3.0.0).
To have SLL start automatically alongside galimulator, use [the installer](https://github.com/Starloader-project/Installer).
